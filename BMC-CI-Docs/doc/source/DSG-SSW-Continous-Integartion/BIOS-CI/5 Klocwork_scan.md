Klocwork scan
===================================
When Klocwork Scan build is running, it will record the relevant files used in the image production process, and
 upload the files to the KW Server for scanning. Therefore, before configuring KW build, you need to first apply to create the corresponding project on the KW Server.\

After creating the corresponding project on KW Server, you can configure KW Build.
